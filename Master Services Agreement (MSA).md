### Basic Terms
This MSA is a legally binding agreement between you and Linode (“**Linode**,” "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**") to which, as conditions precedent to offering you, or the person or entity you represent (“you,” or “your”), any Service, you expressly affirm the accuracy of each of the following statements:

2. You are authorized to enter into this MSA on your behalf or on behalf of the person or entity you represent; 
3. You consent to the application of the laws of the State of New Jersey, United States of America (“US”) and its sole jurisdiction therein;
4. You shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your contact and billing addresses, as indicated in your Account, at all times;
5. You authorize us to appoint our affiliates, subprocessors, and third party service providers to provide ordinary and necessary data processing services related to the Services;
6. You consent to resolve all Disputes arising from or related to the Services in accordance to the Terms of Service and in your individual capacity; 
7. You will immediately notify us in the event your use of any Service is for a non-business purpose; and 
8. You consent to and shall abide by the Terms of Service at all times. 

For your convenience, certain terms used in this MSA are defined in Section 27, or as otherwise first indicated. This MSA shall replace any previously applicable agreements as of the Effective Date.

### Specific Terms 

1. **Applicability of this MSA**. This MSA provides the general terms, conditions, and the framework within which you, your Representatives, your End Users, and the End Users of your Representatives (collectively “Covered Users”) may Process and use the Services. By mutual written agreement, the Parties may enter into one or more Data Processing Addenda, Service Level Addenda, Supplemental Program Addenda, Supplemental Use Policies, and/or Service Orders to specify additional terms and conditions with respect to any Service or Program provided by Linode. For purposes of clarity, a DPA shall generally detail the methodology of how data is Processed by Linode; a SLA shall generally detail the reliability and remedies for deficiency of an applicable Service or Program; a SPA shall generally detail the obligations and responsibilities for participating in an applicable Program; a SUP shall refer to any policy governing the use of the Services; and a Service Order shall generally detail the type and quantity of Service being requested. In the event of a conflict between the terms of a DPA, SLA, SPA, SUP, Service Order and this MSA, the controlling priority of the documents will be in the following order (in decreasing priority): the DPA, SUP, SPA, Service Order, SLA, and this MSA. In the event that you previously entered into an agreement with Linode (an “Existing Terms of Service”), then such Existing Terms of Service shall automatically terminate without any further action by either Party on the Effective Date.

Payment for all Fees are due within three (3) days of invoicing and shall be paid to Linode without setoff, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding. Failure to entirely pay all Fees on a timely basis will result in loss of access to the Account and Service interruption. In the event that you fail to entirely satisfy payment to Linode within thirty (30) days of an invoice, you agree that Linode may, at Linode’s sole and absolute discretion, take any action Linode deems necessary to recover payment, including, without limitation, the use of third party collection agencies.

	- 5.4. **Credits**. Prorated credits may be issued by Linode to you in the event you retain any active Services and have submitted a credit request to Linode due to (i) Linode’s inability to satisfy the Terms of Service or (ii) your downgrade or cancellation of a pre-paid Service. Credit requests can be submitted via your Account, and all credits shall be applied strictly against the monthly payment due for the payment period in which the credits were earned.

The use of Linode Intellectual Property by a Covered User shall be strictly limited to the Term for the Services arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, and shall not be used by any Covered User for any other reason. You shall be responsible for any and all damages resulting from the unauthorized use of Linode Intellectual Property.

7. **Data and Intellectual Property Licenses**. 
	- 7.1. **Identification of the Parties**. Each Party may use the name and logo of the other Party to factually identify Linode as the provider of the Services or that you are a Linode customer and may make no other use of any of such other Party’s Intellectual Property without such other Party’s prior written consent in each instance. Without limitation, the Parties shall not misrepresent or embellish the relationship between you and Linode. Each Party may terminate the other Party’s right to use the applicable Party’s name, logo, and any other marks at any time immediately upon valid Notice.

		In addition, you grant Linode a license to de-personalize and aggregate any of the Covered User Data to determine usage trends, perform analytics, improve the Services, promote and market the effectiveness of the Services, or for any other ordinary business purpose, provided that such uses shall relate to Linode’s obligations to provide the Services to you. Linode shall have no obligation or liability in connection with any use of Covered User Data which is anonymized or otherwise de-personalized, unless, and to the extent, restricted by applicable law. 

8. **Appointment of Third Party Service Providers**. Certain of Linode’s obligations under the Terms of Service may be performed by Third Party Service Providers. The responsibilities, obligations, and the rights of the Parties with respect to the use of Third Party Service Providers are provided in the DPA and Privacy Policy. In addition, you agree that Linode and Linode’s TSPs may Process Covered User Data in locations other than a Covered User’s country, provided that:

Linode, at Linode’s sole and absolute discretion, shall determine if Linode is able to provide the applicable Service without the use of the applicable TSP. If Linode is unable to reasonably satisfy your concerns within ninety (90) days of a TSP Request, you may terminate your Account and request prorated credits or refunds in accordance with the Terms of Service. Your failure to provide written objections or requests within any of the deadlines provided in this section will be deemed to be a waiver of the applicable TSP Request; and 
	- 8.3. Linode shall ensure that Linode TSPs shall only be engaged by a written contract that imposes processing terms which are substantially no less protective of the Covered User Data than the Terms of Service.
