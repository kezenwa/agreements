      * The language "or your written consent" was inserted to the introductory paragraph of section 5 to confirm a Customer's ability to request for the disclosure of their Customer Data to third parties. Please note that Linode has always maintained that all Customer Data stored by a Customer on a Linode Resource belongs to that Customer. This means that each Customer has had, and will continue to have, (i) direct and effective access to their Customer Data and (ii) the right to enable access to their Customer Data to third parties at the Customer's discretion.  
      * The language "in the event of a Customer request for the disclosure of Customer Data, Customer will be responsible for the reasonable cost of disclosure efforts outside of Linode's normal course of business" was also added to section 5 to clarify that Linode will work with Customers on a case-by-case basis for determining the fees associated with Customer disclosure requests outside of Linode's normal course of business. Conversely, disclosure requests which Linode can accommodate in our normal course of business have been, and will continue to be, provided at no cost to Customer.

  * **[Privacy Policy]** Legal Disclosure: The language “subject to service of lawful process” was inserted to Section 5 to make it abundantly clear that Linode only complies with legal disclosure demands when compelled by law. User privacy has been a part of Linode’s DNA since we first opened our doors, and we wanted to make sure our words were as unambiguous as our actions. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Payment Processor Updates: At the request of our payment processor, we globally changed references from Vantiv eCommerce, LLC to Worldpay, Inc. Nothing has substantively changed to the payment process for Linode goods and services.
